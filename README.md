# mp3-player

A very simplistic mp3 player written in python.

I was sick of paying spotify money and thought the default media player is too cluncky, so I made my own!
Folders are your playlists. You are able to change the volume, enable shuffle mode, enable loop mode, skip or rewind songs, and of course stop and play.

As much as it may look simple, it takes 10x less ram than spotify, and 3x less ram than the default media player. 



# file-rename


I've also included a program that renames all your downloaded song.

If you don't have a way yet, you can use spotmate.online for free downloads. It downloads with it's watermark in the name so this is a quick solution to remove in bulk!
