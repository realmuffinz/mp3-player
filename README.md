# mp3-player

A very simplistic mp3 player written in python.

I was sick of paying spotify money and thought the default media player is too cluncky, so I made my own!

Folders are your playlists. You are able to change the volume, enable shuffle mode, enable loop mode, skip or rewind songs, and of course stop and play.




# file-rename


I've also included a program that renames all your downloaded songs.

If you don't have a way yet, you can use spotmate.online (or any other website) for free downloads. It downloads with it's watermark in the name so this is a quick solution to remove in bulk!
